    <p class="about-me-text">I’m Cam, a UX/UI Designer in Atlanta who is still learning about all things UX. <strong>I’m excited by how design can be used to create positive interactions and responses in our world.</strong><br><br>
    When I was a kid, I would bring home a new drawing or craft for my mom everyday. Seeing her delighted reaction never got old and fueled my passion for design.<br><br>
    I don’t bring home macaroni art projects anymore, but my mission remains the same. <strong>I’m here to design experiences that can make someone’s day easier, better, and more enriching.</strong>

<h2>And a special thank you to Caller #8394</h2>
<p class="letter">Dear Caller #8934,

You probably don’t remember me, but I happened to get your call when it was my second day on the job as a new call center agent. <strong>Before I could even say hello, you immediately shouted, “Your entire process so far has been completely stressful — not to mention that I can’t even navigate your stupid site!”</strong><br><br>

I was entirely thrown off and didn’t know how to respond. I probably sounded dumb as I attempted to find the right words before I started to ask you some clarifying questions: What issues are you encountering? What are you trying to locate within your account? And why are you looking for this information? And thankfully, I was able to help you resolve the issue after a few minutes of troubleshooting.<br><br>

<strong>But most of all, I wanted to say thank you. </strong><br><br>
You opened my eyes to the world of user experience design... and how well-designed (or badly designed) experiences can make a difference in someone’s day. <strong>Thousands of phone calls and similar interactions later, you’ve also taught me invaluable lessons for UX:</strong><br><br>

     Listen first, and don’t assume. Ask lots of questions.<br>
     Always focus on the problem.<br>
     Be open to your feedback and criticism.<br>
     Being humble and curious always helps.<br><br>

<strong>As a UX Designer, I hope to create seamless, frustration-free experiences for you.</strong> I promise it’s not our intent to cause you any headaches. So thank you again for calling in -- as I move forward designing, this phone call will be there as a reminder of who I’m designing for.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>
Cam<br>
</p>
