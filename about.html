      <p>I’m Cam, a UX/UI Designer in Atlanta who is still learning about all things UX. <strong>I’m excited by how design can be used to create positive interactions and responses in our world.</strong></p>
      <p>When I was a kid, I would bring home a new drawing or craft for my mom everyday. Seeing her delighted reaction never got old and fueled my passion for design.</p>
      <p>I don’t bring home macaroni art projects anymore, but my mission remains the same. <strong>I’m here to design experiences that can make someone’s day easier, better, and more enriching.</strong></p>

  <h2 class="about-page-heading">And a special thank you to Caller #8394</h2>
    <div class="letter">
      <p>Dear Caller #8934,</p>
      <p>You probably don’t remember me, but I happened to get your call when it was my second day on the job as a new call center agent. <strong>Before I could even say hello, you immediately shouted, “Your entire process so far has been completely stressful — not to mention that I can’t even navigate your stupid site!”</strong></p>
      <p>I was entirely thrown off and didn’t know how to respond. I probably sounded dumb as I attempted to find the right words before I started to ask you some clarifying questions: What issues are you encountering? What are you trying to locate within your account? And why are you looking for this information? And thankfully, I was able to help you resolve the issue after a few minutes of troubleshooting.</p>
      <p><strong>But most of all, I wanted to say thank you. </strong></p>
      <p>You opened my eyes to the world of user experience design... and how well-designed (or badly designed) experiences can make a difference in someone’s day. <strong>Thousands of phone calls and similar interactions later, you’ve also taught me invaluable lessons for UX:</strong></p>

         <p>Listen first, and don’t assume. Ask lots of questions.</p>
         <p>Always focus on the problem.</p>
         <p>Be open to your feedback and criticism.</p>
         <p>Being humble and curious always helps.</p>

      <p><strong>As a UX Designer, I hope to create seamless, frustration-free experiences for you.</strong> I promise it’s not our intent to cause you any headaches. So thank you again for calling in -- as I move forward designing, this phone call will be there as a reminder of who I’m designing for.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Cam</p>
